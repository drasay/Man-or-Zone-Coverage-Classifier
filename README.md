# Man-or-Zone-Coverage-Classifier
Using NFL tracking data, this study compared three AI models to classify defensive coverage. By leveraging a Transformer's self-attention mechanism, the project captured spatial relationships between players better than MLPs or NAMs. Achieving 93.65% pre-snap accuracy, the model proves that player movement patterns can predict Man vs. Zone.
